# Powering Digital Learning, Anywhere 🌍

Hardware Concept | Designed for Rural Education | Solar-Powered & Low-Cost

In a world rapidly transformed by technology, millions of students in rural communities are still left behind—without access to the tools they need to learn, connect, and thrive in the digital age.

SolarTab is a rugged, solar-powered tablet designed to help close that gap. Built for resilience, affordability, and accessibility, it's a learning companion that works even where electricity and internet access are limited.
