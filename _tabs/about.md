📍 Vancouver, Canada

In May, I graduated from Engineering Physics at UBC - a fulfilling (and at times gruelling!) five-year journey filled with late-night study sessions, spontaneous trips, and countless problem sets. 📚🚞

So… what’s next⁉️
<br>

I’m now exploring opportunities that align with my values: creativity, impact, and human-centered design in the tech space. My degree was as technical as it gets 📐, full of physics equations and algorithms, but I’ve also been drawn to design 🎨. Whether i’m sketching and painting in my free time or admiring thoughtfully crafted products (both digital and physical), I’m inspired to build things that make people’s lives better. 
<br>

Last Christmas, I bought a 3D printer 🖨️ just to experiment and create for fun. Over the past year, I collaborated with five others to build Walnut 🌰, an AI-powered note-taking app designed to help people capture their thoughts and lectures seamlessly.
<br>

Beyond tech and design, I’m deeply curious about how people think and about life in general 💭. I’ve explored psychology, philosophy, and Buddhism, which once led me to a week-long silent meditation retreat in Bali 🧘. It was a tranquil, transformative experience I’d recommend to anyone.

From once asking “what’s the meaning of life?” I now believe in making meaning - through purpose-driven work, human connection, and being present in the moment.
