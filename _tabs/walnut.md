## The Problem

Ever tried keeping up with a fast-paced lecture? It's overwhelming (especially if the lecture is in your non-native language). A huge fraction of students often struggle to take accurate notes while simultaneously translating and understanding complex content in real time. Most existing tools focus on either transcription or translation, but not both, and definitely not in a way that supports deep comprehension. The result? Incomplete notes, missed concepts, and a whole lot of academic stress. 😵‍💫
